## Program Description: 
This C program manages and processes simulated aeronautical company data by storing it in an array of structures.
It implements sorting algorithms with varying complexities to organize the data by different fields (such as issue codes or product IDs).
Additionally, a function is coded to copy all the sorted data into a single linked list, allowing efficient search algorithms to find specific issue codes or product IDs based on user input.
